Sales Dashboard â€“ Excel Data Analysis Project

This project presents a Sales Dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to visualize key sales performance metrics and trends.
The dashboard provides an interactive overview of total sales and customers, with detailed analysis by branch, payment method, date, and product category.

Through Excelâ€™s Pivot Tables, Slicers, and charts, the data was transformed into clear, dynamic insights to support business decision-making and identify top-performing branches, preferred payment methods, and seasonal sales patterns.
